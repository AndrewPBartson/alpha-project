## Alpha Project - One project to rule them all

#### Reset Github URL

git remote set-url origin git@github-main:AndrewPBartson/alpha-project.git

### Project design - Not current, see Alpha Mindmap

- Overall goals

  - Framework for building and sharing projects

  - .mmap files

    - not practical for sharing

- Alpha Project website

- Individual project

  - projects vary wildly
  - Every project has a data summary in Firestore
  - The data summary for each project can be edited in Alpha Project ProjectsList

    - Optional project components
      = github repo with readme

      - Notes component - html with tree view - imported from mind map
      - Links component - embedded raindrop object

    - ProjectStatus component

      - for individual project
      - only the most important information

        - Status (active, paused, done, next up)
        - Last touched (date)
        - Reminder notes - One liners like: “needs images,” “waiting on X,” “write summary,” etc.

      - Notes component - project_notes.html
        - autogenerated from .opml when file conversion app notices a new .opml file
        - majority of project information
        - not viewable on GitHub
        - view on GitHub pages or other external website
      - link to project_images.md
        - majority of project images
        - viewable on GitHub
      - link to project_links.md
        - additional links of interest
        - converted from Raindrop
        - viewable on GitHub

  - Full stack app to facilitate file conversion
    - Separate UI and backend for converting files
  - Set of standardized project repos for all my projects

  - GitHub repo - standardized for each project
    - README.md
      - just one paragraph intro to project
    - assets.md
      - images and photos with captions
    - Other files - .html, .js, .json, .pdf and so on
      - html files are not viewable on GitHub

- Functionality
  - Project dashboard w/ status and access points for each project
    - all project data is aggregated in alpha project
    - relevant data is synchronized with each individual project
      Data points
    - Project name
    - Type or category (web, writing, IoT, etc.)
    - Status (active, paused, done, next up) - Essential
    - Last touched (date)
    - Notes - One liners like: “needs images,” “waiting on X,” “write summary,” etc.
    - Link to github repo
    - Link to project website consisting of notes and links
  - File conversion features
    - convert opml files to preliminary json (complete)
    - refactor preliminary json to tree view json (complete)
    - convert csv files to json (under construction)
- Tech Stack

  - Frontend - React
  - Backend - Express
  - Github / GitHub Pages
  - Raindrop - for generating links
  - Obsidian

- Structure of a project -

  - Repos

  - README file
    - is hosted on GitHub repo
    - is edited in VS code
  - Web site - GitHub pages

    - ProjectViewer component
    - loads project summary data from Firestore
    - optional -
      - MindMap HTML
        - from .html conversion of .mmap file
        - try to minimize file size which tends to be huge
      - Tree JSON React / Redux app
        - from .opml conversion of .mmap file
    - Links component
      - Converted from Chrome bookmarks to Raindrop to HTML

### Priority projects

#### Characteristics of priority projects

- Alpha Project
  - ProjectWorkshopo
  - File conversion demo
    - Folder of converted files
      - Spiritual Warrior
- Frontend Simplified
- Existing github repos
- VS code projects
  - Main project controller (see above)
- Collections in raindrop
- Other projects on the ground

### Project repo - Create a repo for each project which contains -

- **index.html**
  - hosted on github pages
  - data is converted to useable json dynamically
    - see file conversion app
  - Components of html page
    - Notes Component
      - clickable tree of notes
      - when notes.opml is saved -> opml -> json -> html
    - Links Component
      - clickable tree of links
      - when links.csv is saved -> json -> html
- **notes.opml**
  - text notes for this project
  - exported from mindmap
  - file may be empty
- **links.csv**
  - links for this project
  - exported from raindrop
  - file may be empty
- **notes.json**
  - is dynamically loaded into notes section of project html page
- **links.json**
  - is dynamically loaded into links section of project html page
- **readme file**
  - has link to project html page hosted on github pages

Goal - provide a clickable tree of notes/subnotes and links that is stored in github.

### Unrelated Unsorted topics

Categories for how to save/reaccess information

- Mainly don't save. Instead google constantly. Looking in notes is often slower. Google-fu is essential, be able to find stuff in seconds, not minutes/hours.

- Save as interesting project by starring it in Github. Not sure about this one?

- Write documentation **directly in the code I'm looking at**.

  - If it's open source and I understand it then I create a pull request and submit the documentation myself.
  - If it's OSS and I don't understand it then I create an issue asking for more documentation, or I comment in the Slack, or Zulip, or Discourse, or wherever it is asking for details. At that point I usually do not have time to update the documentation myself, but I am then able to refer back to my own posts to see old answers for things. You would not believe the number of times I've Googled things years later and found a question I asked and got the answer to, or as is usually the case, didn't ever get an answer to, but maybe now I'm able to answer it with more experience. Not only that but coworkers often find my posts, comments, issues, etc and reach out to me thinking it's funny, because now they have a direct source for the problem. I have had the same happen with other more experienced coworkers, when I find their issues, comments, etc.

- Get comfortable asking questions - see above

- Keep your own knowledge database, such as for interview questions
